<h1>Hi, I'm Eren!



***ME IN A NUTSHELL***
- :zap: I love learning things as a part from the classroom but I also have the ability to self-learn
 - :v: I am ***a positive person*** and I always look forward for new adventures
 - :heart: Technology has always ***motivated*** me to move forward
 - :open_hands: I hate restricting myself to a single domain and ***I extend my interest in multiple domains***
 - 😄  I love archery , food and reading comics.
